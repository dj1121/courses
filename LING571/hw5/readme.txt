HW 5

In this assignment I attempted to create a grammar that was as general as possible.
I had most trouble achieving this with complex sentences involving Wh questions and
auxiliaries such as DO and DOES. My trees are bushy for these types of sentences.

I also accounted for different types of verbs such as intransitive, transitive, present/past etc.
as well as different types of nouns. I included a BASE form of a verb which is meant to be used
when the verb is used in a sentence with auxiliaries such as DO/DOES.

I did not implement a specific syntactic theory, only what came to my mind
as relevant to this problem. A better implementation would contain more abstractions
but this was out of the scope of the homework and would be more relevant to building
a much larger grammar. Therefore it is inevitable that this would fail on more example
sentences, but I think this would be true of any grammar built on such a small set of data.
