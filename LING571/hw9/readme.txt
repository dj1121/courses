HW 9

- I only took the first parse for each sentence out of all possible parses.

- The last sentence was the only sentence that posed some issue. But otherwise, the other 
sentence were straightforward.

- I added newlines for readability.

- I think the algorithm is quite good for being so simple, but obviously has drawbacks as seen in
the last sentence.

- I'd be interested in seeing statistical approaches to solving this problem when a parse tree is
not always available.

- I see this algorithm failing with ambiguities such as in the last sentence and of course when there
is world knowledge that the system does not know. This is why a statistical approach may be better.
